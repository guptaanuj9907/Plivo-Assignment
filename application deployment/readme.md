# Kubernetes Deployment with Zero Downtime

This guide outlines a Kubernetes deployment setup ensuring zero downtime, including service exposure, ingress configuration, disruption handling, autoscaling, network policies, and security.

**Features**

* Zero Downtime Deployments: Using rolling updates.
* Service Exposure: Define services to expose your app.
* Ingress Configuration: Manage external access.
* Disruption Handling: Ensure high availability with Pod Disruption Budgets.
* Autoscaling: Automatically scale pods based on demand.
* Network Policies: Secure communication between pods.
* Service Account with IAM Roles: Assign appropriate IAM roles and policies to the service account.
* Security: Implement best practices for securing the deployment.

**Components**
* Deployment: Ensures rolling updates for zero downtime.
* Service: Exposes the application within the cluster.
* Ingress: Manages external access to the services.
* Pod Disruption Budget: Maintains application availability during maintenance.
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler: Adjusts the number of pods based on CPU utilization.
* Network Policies: Restricts pod communication to enhance security.
* Service Account: Grants necessary permissions through IAM roles.

**Steps**
* Create Deployment: Use rolling updates strategy.
* Define Service: Expose the application using ClusterIP.
* Configure Ingress: Set up ingress rules for external access.
* Set Pod Disruption Budget: Ensure a minimum number of pods are always running.
* Set Up Autoscaling: Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for scaling based on demand.
* Implement Network Policies: Secure communication between pods.
* Configure Service Account: Attach IAM roles and policies for required permissions.

**Security Considerations**
* Use network policies to restrict inter-pod communication.
* Assign the least privilege IAM roles to the service account.
* Regularly update images to include security patches.
* Enable readiness and liveness probes for health checks.
